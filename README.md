## Usage

- Events are fetched automatically every 15 minutes
- The **Sync calendars** action flow card can also be used to trigger a sync

- Only events not started yet or events started but not finished will be fetched
- Recurring events where start date is within 2 months or less will be fetched

### Triggers
- **Event starts** - *will trigger when any event starts*
- **Event starts in** - *will trigger when any event starts in when specified*
- **Event starts from calendar** - *will trigger when any event in specified calender starts*
- **Event stops** - *will trigger when any event stops*

### Conditions
- **Specific event is ongoing** - *will check if specified event is|isn't ongoing*
- **Specific event starts within** - *will check if specified event starts|doesn't start within when specified*
- **Specific event stops within** - *will check if specified event stops|doesn't stop within when specified*
- **Any event is ongoing** - *will check if any event is|isn't ongoing*
- **Any event starts within** - *will check if any event starts|doesn't start within when specified*
- **Any event stops within** - *will check if any event stops|doesn't stop within when specified*

### Actions
- **Sync calendars** - *will download new .ics files to update current events*

### Flow tags on triggers
- Event title
- Event description
- Event location
- Event duration
- Event duration (mintes)
- Calendar name

### Global flow tags (can be used in any app and service)
- Next event title
- Next event start date
- Next event start time
- Next event stop date
- Next event stop time
- Next event duration
- Next event duration (minutes)
- Next event starts in (minutes)
- Next event stops in (minutes)
- Calendar name of next event
- Todays events, title and time
- Todays events (count)
- Tomorrows events, title and time
- Tomorrows events (count)
- Todays events (per calendar)
- Tomorrows events (per calendar)

### Next event tags per calendar (can be turned on in the settings)
- Next event title in %calendarname%
- Next event start date in %calendarname%
- Next event start time in %calendarname%
- Next event stop date in %calendarname%
- Next event stop time in %calendarname%


## Recurring events

### Be aware of *multiple/duplicate* "recurring" events:
- On a recurring event, where one or more participants have declined, that specific event is detached from the recurring event and created as a separate non-recurring event. This can result in two similar events, both have the same name and date.

## Known bugs

- Searching events in condition card, returns no events when search query has a space followed with a character (Example: 'Test f')
